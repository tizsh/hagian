Hagian is a bookmark manager... that does a few more things. 

Unlike the classical bookmark manager (the browser-bound toolbar), Hagian you to store and easily access your favorite bookmarks in a more intuative way.
For one, Hagia is accessed through the browser and allows its users to easily view their favorite interactive sites from a single page.


Hagian is in it's early stages and needless to say many of the more desired features are far from complete. 
With that said, I encourage anyone that comes across this project to participate in it's development and contribute in creating a standarized, appealing app for
all of us that want a more complex and capable bookmarking tool!
